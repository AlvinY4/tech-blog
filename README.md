## User Story

```md
AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions
```

## Description 

Tech Blog is a blog application where users can login in and share and comment tech related idea or just interact with each other. This application was created from scratch using the materials and topics that I have learned so far. I used Handlebars.js for the templating language, sequelize as the ORM, and express-session package for authentication. Check it out for yourself, and feel free to post your thoughts! The heroku link for the blog is down below.
